## 💡 Quick Decision Guide

### "Should I deploy SaaS or sell Enterprise licenses?"

**Deploy SaaS when:**
- ✅ You want recurring revenue ($10-50/user/month)
- ✅ You want to control infrastructure
- ✅ You want to serve many customers quickly
- ✅ Customers want easy setup (no IT required)
- ✅ You want to iterate quickly

**Sell Enterprise when:**
- ✅ Customer requires data sovereignty
- ✅ Customer has strict compliance needs
- ✅ Large deals ($25k-100k/year)
- ✅ Customer has IT team
- ✅ Customer wants full control

**Best Strategy:** Do BOTH!
- Start with SaaS for small/medium customers
- Add Enterprise option for large customers
- Maximize revenue from both segments
